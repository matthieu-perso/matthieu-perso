### Hi, I'm Matthieu ðŸ‘‹

I work at the intersection of technology and humanities - and try to combine the knowledge we've received with the possibilities offered by modern techniques. I'm especially interested in combining LLMs with traditional agent methods and reinforcement learning. 

My team and myself help businesses with AI, usually LLMs and Diffusion models. Our team is research focus - and enable clients to make technology their key advantage. Reach out via mail if I can be of help !
